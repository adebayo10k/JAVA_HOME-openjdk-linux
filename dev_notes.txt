Once I've installed the openjdk version of the Java Development Kit on an Ubuntu machine, I use this procedure to create a JAVA_HOME environment variable that doesn't need to be reconfigured after every upgrade of the openjdk installation.

Firstly, I issue a command to discover the directory in which the java executables are located for this java installation.

```
echo $(readlink -e `which java` | xargs -0 dirname)
```

If I'm happy with the output from that, everything else can be derived from it.

# Configuring the JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables

Rather than adding more and more configurations to the `~/.bashrc` file I've found it a cleaner practice to create a separate small file that  `~/.bashrc` can "include" when it runs.

Let's call that file `~/.java_env_vars` (but you could name it whatever you wish).

## Add an "include condition" to the `~/.bashrc` file
Open `~/.bashrc` in any text editor and these lines to the end of the file:

```
# include the java environment configuration file here (if it exists)
if [ -f "$HOME/.java_env_vars" ]; then
    . $HOME/.java_env_vars
fi
```
## Create the Java environment configuration file
Open any text editor, create the Java environment configuration file `~/.java_env_vars` and add this content to it:

```
#1.  set a java_bin variable to the directory containing the actual Java executables.
java_bin=$(readlink -e `which java` | xargs -0 dirname)

#2. append "$java_bin" to the PATH environment variable
export PATH=$PATH:"$java_bin"

#3. assign the directory of the current Java installation to the JAVA_HOME environment variable.
export JAVA_HOME=$(dirname "$java_bin")
```
NOTE: exporting the PATH and JAVA_HOME variables just ensures that they're always available wherever they're needed.

## Test the Java environment variable configuration

Open a new terminal console, and test your new Java environment variables by issuing this command:

```
echo "$PATH" && echo "$JAVA_HOME"
```

Output should be two lines, something like this:
```
/home/user/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin
/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
```
